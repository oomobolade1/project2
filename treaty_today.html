        <h2>Urban Reserves Today</h2>
        <p>Urban reserves are special areas where First Nations have the right to govern their land within cities. Examples of urban reserves in Manitoba include the Kapyong Urban Reserve, which is a major initiative to build a thriving community.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kapyong Urban Reserve:</strong> Located in Winnipeg, this reserve is a key example of urban development.</li>
            <li><strong>Long Plain First Nations Gas Station:</strong> This is another economic initiative that allows the Long Plain First Nation to benefit from local business activity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>First Nations communities in Treaty 1 have also invested in various business projects. These include casinos, gas stations, and other commercial ventures that help sustain the communities and generate revenue for future development.</p>

        <h3>Challenges of Treaty Implementation</h3>
        <p>While Treaty 1 has provided many benefits, challenges still exist. Some promises made in the treaty, like land payments and access to resources, have been delayed or contested. However, communities continue to work with the government to resolve these issues and ensure the treaty is fully honored.</p>
