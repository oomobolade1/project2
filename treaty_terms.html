            <li>Land for farming: Each family of five received a certain amount of land.</li>
            <li>Annual payments: First Nations were promised regular payments in exchange for land rights.</li>
            <li>Assistance with farming: Tools, animals, and other materials were provided to help with farming.</li>

        <h3>What Makes Treaty 1 Unique?</h3>
        <p>Treaty 1 was the first of many treaties signed in Canada. It set a precedent for the promises and commitments made to First Nations peoples. The treaty focused not only on land but also on providing the tools and support necessary for the First Nations to thrive as agricultural communities.</p>

        <h3>Impact Today</h3>
        <p>The promises made in Treaty 1 still affect the communities today. Many of the commitments, like land payments and educational support, are still being fulfilled, though some promises have been contested over time. In recent years, urban reserves and economic projects have been developed to help First Nations communities thrive.</p>
